# Overview
Udacity's React final project, "MyReads".

Using the provided workspace template, and making it functional:

* The project includes the ability to list pages under 3 categories (*"Currently Reading"*, *"Want To Read"* and *"Read"*).
* A search page allows adding more books.
* A book can be moved to a different category list, or removed entirely.

# Source

* Base template forked from [Udacity's empty MyReads project](https://github.com/udacity/nd0191-c1-myreads).
* [Project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/4971/view) on Udacity's website.

## Credits
* Special thanks to Dan Rees for clarifying about Udacity's search functionality.
